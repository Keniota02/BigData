Tra le cause principali del panico del 2007 vi è stata la creazione di un sistema bancario ombra, emerso a causa dell'aumento della concorrenza e della diminuzione della regolamentazione nel settore finanziario. 3. Il panico bancario si verifica quando i debiti insensibili alle informazioni diventano sensibili alle informazioni a causa di uno shock, con conseguente perdita di fiducia nella loro sicurezza. \n",
