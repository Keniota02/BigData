PAPER__3215	PAPER	Which of the following statements accurately describes a reason for bank runs occurring in a banking system?	Bank runs can occur due to a shift in depositor expectations rather than the actual financial health of the bank.

Consumer expenditure is influenced by an individual's income position in relation to others in the community.	None of the above	D	medium	EN

BOOKS__5502	BOOKS	Which of the following statements best describes the property of the aggregate production function related to diminishing marginal returns?	As additional inputs such as capital, labor, or natural resources are added, the increase in output diminishes incrementally.	The output continues to grow but at a decreasing rate as more capital is added, assuming other factors are constant.	Increases in technology typically lead to an increase in the marginal product of capital, contrary to diminishing returns.	Diminishing returns apply to labor and capital, but human capital and technology may exhibit different patterns, sometimes showing increasing returns initially.	None of the above	A	medium	EN

The incentives for performing the more valuable activity increase, while the incentives for other activities remain unchanged.	The incentives for the more valuable activity decrease, and the incentives for other activities increase to compensate.

It suggests that investors should only focus on maximizing expected returns without considering risk.	It indicates that diversification is unnecessary if an investor is seeking the highest return possible.	It implies that investors should select portfolios that maximize expected return while minimizing variance, encouraging diversification.	It promotes the idea that all investments should be concentrated in a single security to enhance returns.	None of the above	C	medium	EN

PAPER__2869	PAPER	Under conditions of asymmetric information, why might a firm choose to rely more on debt financing rather than equity financing when raising funds for a valuable investment opportunity?	Debt financing does not require any firm collateral and is always cheaper than equity financing.	Investors predict that equity issuance signals potential negative value for the firm, thus firms prefer to avoid negative signals by using debt.	Debt financing allows firms to bypass the market entirely, as no information is needed for issuing debt.	Firms can always issue stock without concern for existing shareholders' interests, making equity financing less risky than debt.	None of the above	B	medium	EN
