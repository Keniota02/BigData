PAPER__3038	PAPER	Which of the following statements correctly describes the impact of European colonial strategies on current economic institutions?	Extractive institutions were established in regions where Europeans could settle without high mortality, leading to stronger economic outcomes today.	Higher settler mortality rates likely led to the establishment of stronger institutions because fewer settlers resulted in less competition for resources.	Countries where Europeans established extractive institutions during colonization are, on average, today more economically prosperous than those with settler colonies.	Regions with high settler mortality rates were more likely to develop institutions that favor private property and rule of law, affecting their economic performance today.	None of the above	EN
